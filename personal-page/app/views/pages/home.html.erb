      <h1> ABOUT ME </h1>
      I am a recent graduate of a highly ranked university with a degree in International Relations with some experience promoting brands and marketing products to business and consumers. My experience working on Amazon China’s website, along with a lifelong passion for technology led me to pursue a career in web development. As a graduate of General Assembly’s immersive 3-month web development program, I am well-versed in modern development languages, frameworks, libraries, and techniques. I am currently looking for opportunities to refine my newly learned skills.
